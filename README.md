Fallout Shelter Save Editor

Found a program to decrypt the Fallout Shelter save files from Android but
that was all it did, so I've decided to start making something with a few
more features to make editing the save data even easier and hopefully safer.

In the very very very early stages, seriously don't expect much!

Implemented so far:
	Decrypt and open files in .sav format
	Rough cut of the class structure to hold data from the decrypted JSON

Notes:
	- Uses the JSON.net library to simplify reading the save data
	- Only tested with saves from Android
	- I'm very new to C# so if I do anything too nasty do let me know, I'm here
      to learn too!
	- I'm not particularly keen to include LunchBox manipulation, I don't want
      to discourage Bethesda from continuing to improve the game in the future
	  
	  Fork, share and enjoy :)
